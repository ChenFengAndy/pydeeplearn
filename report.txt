# Introduction
  The aim of the project.
  clarify this iwth abbas

# Background

## History of machine learning and progresses

## Neural networks

 City some semnficant results and their decay
 Quote Hinton in the reasons that neural nets were abandoned (lack of CPU, too much backprop, not enough labeled data)

 Why deep nets did not work before. Talk about how with the pre trained nets you have the guarantte to get better results
  than you got beore

 Backpropagation here?

## Hopfield networks
  Add nice pics.

  Do not talk much about them


## Boltzmann machines
  Stochastic hopfield nets
  Talk about the issues with their training algorithms

## Restricted Boltzmann machines
  Idea.
  Why they are easier to train and understand than

## Pre training
  Using unsupervised learning for supervised learning
  This is important and sketch the importance of learned features

  Mention auto encoders and deep auto encoders vs PCA

## Deep belief networks

  use of backpropagation.
  stacking multiple RBMs
  ### Softmax units
